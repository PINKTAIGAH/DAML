### Explanation for excersice 3 ###

The larger significance obtained by reducing the bounds of the distribution indicates that it is less probable that a linear 
distibuition within the bounds of (5, 15) and with an expected number of events of 5000 would fluctuate to have the number 
of events if we run a simulation and a signal with background whithin the same bounds with an expected number opf additional events of ~500.

The reason for the increase in significance from the experiemtns in excersice 2 and 3 is that by enforcing the bounds (5, 15),
your selection only cuts events that were generated by the background distribution, while all events generated by the signal 
are kept. This means that events generated by the background make up a smaller percentage from the overall number of events in the 
distribution.

In (0, 20), background makes up 10000/10300 ~ 97% of all events
In (5, 15), background makes up (5000)/(5300) ~ 94% of all events

Hence assuming that the distribution of events for a linear background is gaussian (using poisson -> gausisan estimation)
the point 5300 would be further from the mean ifthe mean is equal to 5000, compared to the "distance" between the the point 
10300 and the mean if the mean were 10000.
