    "In the project report you will be assessed in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data exploration and preprocessing (20%):** Inspect the datasets; visualise the data (e.g. tables, plots, etc) in an appropriate way; study the composition of the dataset; perform any necessary preprocessing.\n",
    "2. **Model selection (30%):** Choose a promissing approach; construct the machine learning model; optimise the relevant hyperparameters; train your chosen model.\n",
    "3. **Performance evaluation (30%):** Evaluate the model in a way that gauges its ability to generalise to unseen data; compare to other approaches; identify the best approach. \n",
    "4. **Discussion, style throughout (20%):** Discuss the reasoning or intuition behind your choices; the results you obtain through your studies; the relative merits of the methods you have developed, _etc._ Similarly, make sure that you write efficient code, document your work, clearly convey your results, and convince us that you have mastered the material.\n",

    "* The data is provided in a CSV (text) format with semicolon and comma seperated list with **one line per event**. We need to convert this into an appropiate format for our neural networks. \n",
    "* Since the number of particles per event is variable you will need to **truncate** and **mask** particles in the event. The following steps need to be perfomed on the SM (background) sample:\n",
    "     1. Create variables where you count the number of electrons, photons, muons, jets and bjets in the event (ignore charge) before any truncation.\n",
    "     2. Choose an appropiate number of particles to study per event (recommended: **8** particles are used in the paper)\n",
    "     3. Check the particles are sorted by energy (largest to smallest)\n",
    "     4. If the event has more than 8 particles choose the **8 particles** with **highest energy and truncate** the rest.\n",
    "     5. convert energy and momentum variables by logarithm (e.g., `log`) - this is to prioritise differences in energy **scale** over more minor differences. \n",
    "     6. If the event has less than 8 particles, create kinematic variables with 0 values for the missing particles.\n",
    "* The final set of training variables should look something like this (the exact format is up to you)\n",
    "    |N ele| N muon| N jets| N bjets| N photons| log(MET)| METphi| log(E1)| log(pt1)| eta1| phi1| ... | phi8|\n",

    "* After the SM dataset has been processed use the same processing on the BSM (signal samples). Use the same standardisation functions as on the SM dataset, *Do not recalculate the standardisation*.\n",
    "* Keep associated metatata (`event ID; process ID; event weight;`) though this does not need processing. \n",
    "* Randomise and split the SM (background) dataset into training and testing datasets (the BSM samples don't need to be split (*Why?*))\n",

After you have done the data processing its suggested you save the datasets so as to not have to recalculate them again if the kernel is restarted. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Training\n",
    "* Design an appropiate algorithm which reconstrucuts the input variables after going though a laten space. Choose an appropiate cost function.\n",
    "    * The suggested method for ease of implementation is the `AutoEncoder`\n",
    "    * However, if you consider learning about or trying something else, as described in the paper, you should feel welcome to try `VAEs`, `ConvAEs`, `ConvVAEs`, etc. Don't feel you **have** to create an `AE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explore different architectures for the model, and explain in detail your choice of model, and the final parameters chosen.\n",
    "* It is suggested to create a class or function around your algorithm which allows you to easily tweek hyperparameters of the model (depth, number of nodes, number of laten variables, activation functions, regularisation, etc)\n",
    "* Train the model over several parameters to find the best algorithm. Document the process throught and discuss your choices. Keep track of validation performance. Save the models the best points. \n",
    "* Explore the results and document your findings. Ask as many questions about your model as you can, and document your findings. Does the model generalise well to data it hasn't seen?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "In the evaluation explore different datasets an try answer as many questions about the performance as possible. \n",
    "* Evaluate the performance of the `AE` on BSM dataset. Which models are more or less similar to the SM?\n",
    "* Explore the anomaly score as a handle on finding new physics. Consider scanning over different anomaly scores and calculating the signal and background efficiencies at each point (plot this for different BSM models). How might you choose a value which flags up a non-SM event? \n",
    "* Explore SM events. Which look more anomolous than others? Are there any particular features which are responsible, e.g. particle counts, MET ranges, etc.? \n",
    "* Discuss any limitations your algorithm has. How might you update and improve your model in future? Discuss any issues you had, or things you would have liked to try given more time."

    "This is not in the form of a written report so do not provide pages of background material. Only provide a brief explanation for each step. Aim to clearly present your work so that the markers can easily follow your reasoning and can reproduce each of your steps through your analysis. Aim to convince us that you have understood the material covered in the course.\n",

    "To add commentary above (or below) a code snippet create a new cell and add your text in markdown format. __Do not__ add commentary or significant text as a code comment in the same cell as the code.\n",

    "When you are ready to submit your report perform the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    " -  In Jupyter run `Kernel` -> `Restart Kernel ` and ` Clear All Outputs `\n",
    " -  Then `Kernel` -> `Restart & Run All ` to ensure that all your analysis  is reproducible and all output can be regenerated\n",
    " -  Save the notebook, and close Jupyter\n",
    " -  **Change the filename to contain Name_Surname**\n",
    " -  Tar and zip your project folder if you have multiple files in a working directory. You are free to include any supporting code. Make sure this belongs in the project folder and is referenced correctly in your notebook. Do __not__ include any of the input data.\n",
    " -  Submit this file or zipped folder through Learn. In case of problems or if your compressed project folder exceeds 20 MB (first make sure you are not including any CSV files, then) email your submission to Kieran (the course administrator) at the Teaching Office and me."
